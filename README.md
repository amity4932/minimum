predict natural disaster

We are focusing on these major kinds of natural disasters:
•	Floods
•	Drought
•	Earthquake
•	Cyclone
•	Tsunami
•	Forest Fire

1.Flood:

Flood can be predicted easily because they come with high rainfall, Humidity and drop in temperature and change in wind speed. So, to predict the flood we will build a model which will predict the flood on the basis of above-mentioned changes and the dangerous water level. In this model we will also include the effect of weather changes of area on the bank of same river.

2. Drought:

India being an agrarian economy is adversely affected by droughts. We will develop the model which will predict the drought on the basis of moisture content of the south west monsoon and the average insolation by comparing it with the data available on internet during the drought time.

3.Earthquakes:

Earthquake cannot be predicted so early, so we will be making a platform to give precautions and warning system. For better analysis we collect dataset from the general public the changes in the surrounding prior to earthquake and we decide the emergency plans before and after the earthquake.

4.Cyclone:

Tropical cyclones are often difficult to predict, as they suddenly become weak or change their course. So, we build a model collecting large dataset and with neural network training we can predict it upto a certain extent, or we can use wind pressure.

5.Forest fire:

It can be predicted as they can come above a certain temperature, relative humidity, or it also depend upon the wind speed, cloud development of the area. So, we develop a model which will predict the forest fire on the basis of above-mentioned changes.
